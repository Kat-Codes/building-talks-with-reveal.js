        So let's get into it! What is Reveal.js? A framework. In this talk I
        will be using React as my HTML rendering library of choice but this is
        completely optional

          <li>So what are some of the features of reveal?</li>
          <li>
            For example, both in previous jobs and my current one, I use React
            with some libraries like styled components so I'm very comfortable
            with them, therefore I can use them while I built these slides and
            it felt very intuitive.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you don't want to create your colour scheme from scratch, there
            are some lovely themes built in
          </li>
          <li>
            There is also the option to use this library with no code! So you
            can make use of all the great features without needing to code
            yourself
          </li>
        </ul>
