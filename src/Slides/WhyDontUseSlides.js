          It's a pretty common joke that node_modules can grow astranomical, so
          you can end up with a lot of storage taken up. (Node modules was 400mb
          at the time of editing) However, if you've used something like
          Keynote, you know that also takes up a lot of storage. At least with
          Reveal you can use git.
